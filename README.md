# Daily Vibes

[Download](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/id1332324033) the iOS app on Apple Store.

Stressed? Overwhelmed? Not sure where to begin? Donâ€™t worry! Everyone has been there. I have three simple steps to get you started.

- the first step is wanting to change
- the next step is to be mindful and deliberate
- the final step is to measure.

Why? Because you cannot improve what you do not measure.

## FAQ

- Yes, Mac version is planned ... waiting for marzipan news.
- Yes, Android version has been asked for ... need $$$ for flagship device(s) and a new main machine first. Why? So I can handle the various code bases. The current main machine is approaching its limits for a good daily driver.
