This week I want to talk about a feature I’ve added in my application that I thought was pretty cool, and I’ve decided why not share this to my audience. The feature I am referring to is an UIAlertController with a text field. Adding alert controller is not only a great way for displaying data and error, but it is also helpful in prompting a user to input some relevant information. I want to give you a short tutorial on how to implement the text field inside of an UIAlertController. Let’s get started!
