Thank you for using Daily Vibes. It is an indie software project developed by me, Alex Kluew, in Toronto, Canada. 

- work began in November 2017
- public release in January 2018
- initial release attributed to successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/471588901/daily-vibes)
<br />

It is hard for me to describe what Daily Vibes exactly is or my vision for the end product. I can tell you that I am interested in great software, life long learning, and self improvement. 

Daily Vibes merges my formal training in software engineering and psychology. I think that I am in a unique position of creating a useful daily tool. This software is part of my journey of applying my skills at solving real problems.

Daily Vibes is not exactly a solo project. My better half, Laura, better known online as [lastminutelaura.ca](https://lastminutelaura.ca), has a huge impact on product development.

If you have any product or business suggestions, please do send them my way and we can chat about it. I use Daily Vibes every single day and I am always thinking about it. Thus, it is always nice to hear a fresh take on my solutions.

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day.
I hope you enjoy using this software and find it useful.

Sincerely,
Alex
